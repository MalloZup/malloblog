Hi, i work for @SUSE Linux and maintain several opensource projects. 
I like to share ideas, Programming paradigm, Design Principles, Architecture and everything that help people maintain a codebase healty.
I think coding is about people and maintaining software under unpredictables situations and continous changes : )
